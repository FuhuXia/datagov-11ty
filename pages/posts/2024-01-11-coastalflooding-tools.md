Here are a few government and non-government software tools to help coastal communities and others analyze and assess vulnerabilities to sea level rise, storm surges, and sinking lands.

**General Resources**

*   **[Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) Land Cover Atlas:](https://coast.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/tools/lca.html)** Provides access to regional land cover and land cover change information.
*   **[Climate Resilience Evaluation and Awareness Tool (CREAT):](https://www.epa.gov/crwu/climate-resilience-evaluation-and-awareness-tool-creat-risk-assessment-application-water)** Provides information on climate impacts to assist water utilities in assessing future risks and vulnerabilities.
*   **[Coastal Change Hazards Portal:](https://marine.usgs.gov/coastalchangehazardsportal/)** The U.S. Geological Survey is uncovering the science behind coastal change hazards and providing data, tools, and scientific knowledge to help coastal planners as they work to reduce risk along our coastlines.
*   **[Coastal County Snapshots:](https://coast.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/tools/snapshots.html)** Turns complex data into easy-to-understand stories for coastal county resilience, complete with charts and graphs.
*   **[Coastal Flood Exposure Mapper:](https://coast.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/tools/flood-exposure.html)** Provides access to different Flood Exposure Maps showing flood hazards and different aspects of community exposure.
*   **[Coastal Resilience:](https://coastalresilience.org/)** Delivers geospatial information on coastal ecosystems, socioeconomics, community vulnerability, and coastal hazards (including sea level rise and storm surge) via an internet mapping application that is a data viewer, data discovery tool, and a future scenario mapper.
*   **[Digital Coast:](https://www.coast.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/)** Provides relevant data and tools necessary to assess coastal management issues such as coastal inundation, offshore renewable energy planning, coastal wetlands conservation, and sea level rise adaptation.
*   **[Disasters Community on GeoPlatform:](https://disasters-geoplatform.hub.arcgis.com/)** Whole community geospatial data, tools, and resources for disaster response and resiliency.
*   **[Extreme Water Levels:](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/est/)** Provides annual and monthly exceedance probability levels for select Center for Operational and Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) water level stations with at least 30 years of data.
*   **[Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) GeoPlatform:](https://fema.maps.arcgis.com/home/index.html)** Provides geospatial data and analytics in support of emergency management.
*   **[FEMA Region II Coastal Analysis and Mapping:](https://r2-coastal-fema.hub.arcgis.com/)** View FEMA Flood Hazard Data for New Jersey and New York.
*   **[Coastal Flood Risk:](https://www.fema.gov/flood-maps/coastal)** Provides information on FEMAâ€™s efforts in coastal flood risk mapping and mitigation.
*   **[Hawaii Emergency Management Agency Tsunami Evacuation Zones:](https://dod.hawaii.gov/hiema/public-resources/tsunami-evacuation-zone/)** Online access to Hawaii tsunami evacuation zone maps, as well as information about potential risks, how to prepare, and what to do in the event of a tsunami.
*   **[Hurricane SANDY Response Imagery:](https://geodesy.noaa.gov/storm_archive/storms/sandy/index.html)** This rapid response imagery product was generated for use by emergency managers for visual analysis of damage in the Sandy impact area.
*   **[Coastal Inundation Dashboard:](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/inundationdb/)** Helps in determining the frequency (or occurrence of high waters for different elevations above a specified threshold) and duration (or the amount of time that the specified location is inundated by water) of observed high waters (tides).
*   **[MarineCadastre.gov:](https://www.marinecadastre.gov/)** Provides spatial context needed to address issues such as alternative energy and other types of marine planning efforts.
*   **[National Stormwater Calculator (SWC):](https://www.epa.gov/water-research/national-stormwater-calculator)** Estimates the annual amount of rainwater and frequency of runoff from a specific site anywhere in the United States (including Puerto Rico).
*   **[Planning for Changing Sea Levels:](https://www.usace.army.mil/corpsclimate/Planning-for-Changing-Sea-Levels/)** Helps the public gain a general understanding of potential future vulnerabilities to changing sea levels, waves, tides, and surges in the New York and New Jersey areas.
*   **[Sea Level Rise Viewer:](https://www.coast.noaa.gov/slr/)** A slider bar shows how various levels of sea level rise will impact coastal communities.
*   **[Relative Sea Level Trends:](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/sltrends.html)** Illustrates regional trends in sea level, with arrows representing the direction and magnitude of change. Click on an arrow to access additional information about that station.
*   **[Surging Seas:](http://sealevel.climatecentral.org/)** Provides local regions and policy makers with the tailored local information they need to understand and respond to the risks of sea level rise and coastal flooding.
*   **[United States Interagency Elevation Inventory:](https://coast.noaa.gov/inventory/)** Displays availability of high-accuracy topographic and bathymetric data for the United States and its territories.
