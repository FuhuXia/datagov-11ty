The U.S. Government and its partners have been collecting data relevant to the vulnerability of the food system to climate change for over a century. Useful datasets on this topic include the Census of Agriculture, the leading source of facts and figures about American agriculture that is collected every five years for every state and county in the United States. Another key resource is the current and historical data on production, supply and distribution of agricultural commodities for the U.S. and key producing and consuming countries. Here you will find these and other resources related to the impacts of climate change on the production and distribution of food. You will also find resources that show how climate change can impact international food security. Citizens, communities, businesses, and governments can use these resources to be better prepared for climate-related impacts. You may access the [framing questions](https://www.data.gov/climate/foodresilience/foodresilience-framing-questions/) used to select the data and content available for this theme. [All Food Resilience data](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/?groups=climate5434&vocab_category_all=Food+Resilience) are organized around four different topic areas:

[Food Production](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/?groups=climate5434&vocab_category_all=Food+Production)
[Food Distribution](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/?groups=climate5434&vocab_category_all=Food+Distribution)
[Food Safety and Nutrition](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/?groups=climate5434&vocab_category_all=Food+Safety+and+Nutrition)
[Food Security](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/?groups=climate5434&vocab_category_all=Food+Security)
