Ecosystems are essential to the survival of species and their habitats. They provide life-sustaining services to humans by supplying clean water, food, and other natural resources. The productivity of these ecosystems is being impacted by climate change, threatening the livelihood of those that rely on them. Therefore it has become increasingly important to establish adaptation strategies and improve the resiliency of global ecosystems. Here you can discover and access data, information, and decision tools describing and analyzing ecosystem vulnerability to climate change. The resources address the impacts of climate variability and change on water resources, wildfires, biodiversity, the prevalence of invasive species, and the ability of ecosystems to sequester carbon. You may also access the [framing questions]({{'/climate/ecosystem-vulnerability/ecosystem-vulnerability-framing-questions/' | url}}) used to select the data and content available for this theme. Use the Data.gov data search portal to locate [all Ecosystem Vulnerability datasets](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/?groups=climate5434&vocab_category_all=Ecosystem+Vulnerability).
