There is a range of software tools available to help analyze and assess impacts of a changing climate on the water cycle. These tools provide users with convenient data access capabilities, common data transformation utilities, and analysis methods for data and related information.

**General Resources**

* **[National Stormwater Calculator](https://www.epa.gov/water-research/national-stormwater-calculator)**: EPA’s National Stormwater Calculator (SWC) is a desktop application that estimates the annual amount of rainwater and frequency of runoff from a specific site anywhere in the United States (including Puerto Rico). Estimates are based on local soil conditions, land cover, and historic rainfall records.
* **[BASINS (Better Assessment Science Integrating point & Non-point Sources)](https://www.epa.gov/ceam/better-assessment-science-integrating-point-and-non-point-sources-basins)**: Better Assessment Science Integrating Point and Non-point Sources (BASINS) is a multipurpose environmental analysis system designed to help regional, state, and local agencies perform watershed- and water quality-based studies.
* **[Geo Data Portal](https://labs.waterdata.usgs.gov/gdp_web/)**: The Geo Data Portal helps scientists and decision-makers construct ensembles and compare climate hind casts and future projections for particular spatial areas. It helps with data management for modeling and assessing the impacts of future climate conditions.
* **[Creating Resilient Water Utilities](https://www.epa.gov/crwu)**: EPA’s Creating Resilient Water Utilities (CRWU) initiative assists the water sector, which includes drinking water, wastewater, and stormwater utilities, in addressing climate change impacts.
* **[National Integrated Drought Information System Tools](https://www.drought.gov/data-maps-tools)**: National Integrated Drought Information System (NIDIS) is a multi-agency partnership that coordinates drought monitoring, forecasting, planning, and information at federal, tribal, state, and local levels across the country.
* **[Exploration and Graphics for RivEr Trends (EGRET)](https://github.com/DOI-USGS/EGRET)**: An R-package for the analysis of long-term changes in water quality and streamflow, including the water-quality method Weighted Regressions on Time, Discharge, and Season (WRTDS)
* **[NOAA Weather and Climate Toolkit](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/wct/)**: NOAA’s Weather and Climate Toolkit (WCT) is free, platform independent software distributed from NOAA’s National Climatic Data Center (NCDC). The WCT allows the visualization and data export of weather and climate data, including Radar, Satellite and Model data.
* **[Global Precipitation Measurement Education Tools](https://gpm.nasa.gov/education/)**: This website, presented by NASA’s Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission, provides students and educators with resources to learn about Earth’s water cycle, weather and climate, and the technology and societal applications of studying them.
* **[Geospatial Data Abstraction Library](https://gdal.org/)**: The Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) is a translator library for raster and vector geospatial data formats.
* **[Giovanni – Interactive Visualization and Analysis](https://giovanni.gsfc.nasa.gov/giovanni/)**: Giovanni is a web application that provides a simple, intuitive way to visualize, analyze, and access vast amounts of Earth science remote sensing data, particularly from satellites, without having to download the data.
