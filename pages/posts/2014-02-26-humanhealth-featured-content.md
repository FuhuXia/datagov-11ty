The [2018 U.S. National Climate Assessment](https://nca2018.globalchange.gov/)’s chapter on [Human Health](https://nca2018.globalchange.gov/chapter/14/) provides a comprehensive overview of the latest scientific information on the impacts of climate change on public health. Exploring the following resources should provide a greater understanding of human health vulnerability to climate change and other stressors.

*   The [National Air Quality Forecast Capability (NAQFC)](https://vlab.noaa.gov/web/osti-modeling/air-quality) provides the U.S. with ozone, fine particulate matter (PM2.5), smoke, and dust forecasts with enough accuracy and advance notice to take action to prevent or reduce adverse effects.

*   The [Food Safety Information](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/food-safety-information-rss-feed#topic=humanhealth_navigation) feed is produced in real-time by the CDC and results from the integration of information from the USDA’s Food Safety Inspection Service and the FDA’s Food Safety Recalls.

*   The [CDC Health Alert Network (HAN)](https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/) provides urgent public health information through the HAN messaging system including alerts, advisories, updates, and information services relevant to public health events such as wildfire smoke exposure or incidence of malaria.

*   The [Nutrient and Coliform Loading (NCL)](https://products.coastalscience.noaa.gov/ncl/) database is a compilation of available fecal coliform bacteria, fecal streptococci bacteria, and nutrient loading data and can be used to quickly identify available measures of loading from different land uses and animals.
