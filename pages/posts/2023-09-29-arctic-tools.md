*   **[Global Climate Observing System (GCOS):](https://gcos.wmo.int/en/home)** GCOS is intended to be a long-term, user-driven operational system capable of providing the comprehensive observations required for various aspects of climate science. GCOS includes components focused on obtaining a comprehensive view of the spatial structure, trends, and variability of changes in active-layer thickness and permafrost temperature in the Arctic.
*   **[USGS Groundwater Levels REST Web Service URL Generation Tool:](https://waterservices.usgs.gov/rest/GW-Levels-Test-Tool.html)** This tool provides a simple way to generate syntactically correct URLs to use with the USGS Groundwater Levels REST web service. Please note: this service provides historical, manually recorded groundwater levels only, which in many cases are decades old. Groundwater levels recorded by automated equipment are *not* provided by this service, but recent automated groundwater levels are available using the **[Instantaneous Values Web Service](https://waterservices.usgs.gov/rest/IV-Service.html)**.
*   **[Ice-tethered Profilers (ITPs):](https://www2.whoi.edu/site/itp/)** ITP’s are inverted moorings with an anchor in a drifting ice floe supporting a cable that extends 800-1000 m below the floe. A vehicle with temperature and salinity sensors motors up and down the cable making Lagrangian measurements. ITPs have been deployed since 2004 with support primarily from the National Science Foundation.
*   **[Imiq Hydroclimate Data Portal:](https://imiq.portal.aoos.org/)** The Imiq Hydroclimate Data Portal provides access to the Imiq Hydroclimate Database, a central repository built by researchers at the University of Alaska Fairbanks containing hydrologic and climate-related data from Alaska and nearby regions (The word *Imiq* means ‘freshwater’ in the Inupiat language of Northern Alaska.)
*   **[USGS Instantaneous Values REST Web Service URL Generation Tool:](https://waterservices.usgs.gov/rest/IV-Test-Tool.html)** This tool provides a simple way to generate syntactically correct URLs to use with the USGS Instantaneous Values REST web service. Use it to get comfortable with the service before creating your own applications.
*   **[Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS):](https://usicecenter.gov/Products/ImsHome)** The IMS is an operational software package maintained by the U.S. National Ice Center for mapping snow and ice. The IMS provides northern hemisphere snow/ice charts and data files for current and archived data.
*   **[Marginal Ice Zone Departmental Research Initiative (MIZ DRI):](https://apl.uw.edu/project/project.php?id=miz)** This research initiative was a five-year (2012-2016) Office of Naval Research project with two objectives: (1) Understand atmosphere-ice-ocean-wave interactions and feedbacks in the summer marginal ice zone of the Beaufort Sea north of Alaska in order to improve coupled models and sea-ice prediction, and (2) demonstrate robotic technology for integrated observation of the coupled atmosphere-ice-ocean-wave system of the marginal ice zone.
*   **[National Land Cover Database:](https://www.mrlc.gov/eva/)** This National Land Cover Database Evaluation Visualization and Analysis (NLCD EVA) tool provides user-friendly access to national and state land-cover and land-cover-change information developed through the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium. NLCD EVA eliminates the need for desktop geographic information system software, or advanced technical expertise, by processing NLCD data for the user and providing easy access to that distilled information. The tool also summarizes general land-change trends and provides users with the option to specify and explore specific land-change classes of interest (e.g., forest-to-urban land change).
*   **[Next Generation Ecosystem Experiments (NGEE) Arctic:](https://ngee-arctic.ornl.gov/)** NGEE (Next Generation Ecosystem Experiments) Arctic is a Department of Energy program to improve process understanding and model representation of important ecosystem-climate feedbacks by quantifying the physical, chemical, and biological behavior of terrestrial ecosystems in Alaska.
