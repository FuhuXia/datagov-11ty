An increase in global sea level poses a major threat to global coastal communities and habitats. Coastal flooding from high tides, tropical cyclone storm surge, tsunamis, and heavy precipitation events is projected to increase in frequency and severity. To combat the impacts of sea level rise due to climate change, it is important to be aware of coastal flooding risks and prepare effective adaptation strategies. Here you will find resources that help shed light on the risks of near-term coastal flooding and future sea level rise scenarios. You can find tools from inside and outside the government on coastal vulnerability and related climate change risks and impacts. You may also access the [framing questions](https://data.gov/climate/coastal-flooding-questions/) used to select the data and content available for this theme. Use the Data.gov data search portal to locate [all Coastal Flooding datasets](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/?groups=climate5434&vocab_category_all=Coastal+Flooding).
