Both climate impacts and transportation systems are distributed spatially. To map climate impacts to transportation infrastructure, we need to match the locations of the infrastructure to the impacts, and, this in turn requires maps or geocoded data sets. Here are a few examples of the maps and datasets available that are useful in analyzing the vulnerability of the transportation system to changes in climate.

**Caution:** Most of the maps and datasets were desired to provide accurate information as of a particular date, at a particular scale, and for a particular set of purposes. There are inevitably issues that arise in using and overlaying data from multiple sources, particularly at higher resolutions, and for different purposes then originally envisioned when the data was collected.
