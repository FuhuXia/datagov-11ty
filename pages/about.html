        Under the OPEN Government Data Act, which is Title II of the <a

          Act</a>, government data is required to be made
        available in open, machine-readable formats, while continuing to ensure privacy and security.

        Government data publishers looking to get their data on Data.gov should read the detailed guide: <a
          href="https://resources.data.gov/tools/how-to-get-your-open-data-on-datagov/" target="_blank"
          class="usa-link usa-link--external">How to
          get your open data on Data.gov</a>. The Data.gov team typically works with a designated open data point of
        contact as a liaison for each agency. Data publishers should consult with their agency point of contact to
        include any additional datasets on Data.gov. If you need help determining who your open data point of contact
        is, please <a href="{% page '/contact/'%}">contact us</a>.

        <b>Federal agencies are required to:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a Single Agency Data Inventory.** Agencies are required to catalog their data assets, just like
            they would inventory computers or desk chairs, to better manage and use these resources.</li>
          <li>Publish a Public Data Listing.** Agencies are required to publish a list of their data assets that are
            public, or could be made public. This list is made available as a data.json hosted at the primary domain
            of
            the agency (e.g.) <a href="https://open.gsa.gov/data.json" target="_blank"

          v1.1</a>, and are then harvested into the central catalog for
        Data.gov. Each agency is responsible for its own data.
