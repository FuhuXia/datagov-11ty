title: Data.gov Launches New Catalog and APIs
---

Data.gov is launching two innovations today to mark both the anniversary of the [Digital Government Strategy](../datagov/wordpress/2013/10/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government-strategy.pdf) and the fourth anniversary of Data.gov. First is a comprehensive listing of the [application programming interfaces](../developers/page/developer-resources.html) (APIs) that were released from across the federal government as part of the Digital Government Strategy. These APIs will fuel the development of new apps on everything from health, public safety, education, consumer protection, and many more topics of interest to Americans. Developers can find all the government’s APIs in one place, with links to API documentation and other resources.

Data.gov is also launching a new [data catalog](https://catalog.data.gov/) on an open source data management system called [CKAN](https://ckan.org/)  The new catalog features a number of enhancements, such as an improved search that helps you find all the datasets for a particular location, better sorting and tagging of datasets, and more robust metadata. Data.gov now has one unified data catalog based on an open source standard that will make it easier to federate with other federal agency catalogs, as well as those of [states](../states/community/states.html), [cities](../cities/community/cities.html), and [counties](../counties/community/counties.html).
