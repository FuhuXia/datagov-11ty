**Tribal Nations Featured Tools**

This page contains links to web-based tools, training, and guidance to help understand, analyze, and assess the vulnerabilities and resilience of Tribal Nations to climate variability, global climate change, and compounding stressors. Tools include [Guidance for Using Traditional Knowledges](https://toolkit.climate.gov/tool/guidelines-considering-traditional-knowledges-climate-change-initiatives), as well as, other unique tools develop by tribes and partners to specifically address ways to analyze and address climate change impacts in an appropriate cultural and place-based context. You may review tools by ALL or each of the six subtopics representing climate resilience strategies that [Tribal Nations](https://toolkit.climate.gov/topics/tribal-nations) employ in U.S. Climate Resilience Toolkit, as well as, by the [Arctic Topic](https://toolkit.climate.gov/regions/alaska-and-arctic). Please [let us know](../../climate-feedback/) if there are other tools that should be listed here.

All items listed here in the Tools section are also found among the [Tools included in the U.S. Climate Resilience Toolkit](https://toolkit.climate.gov/tools?f[0]=field_parent_topic%3A889). Items found in the [Resources > Featured Content section](../tribal-nations-featured-content.html) of the Tribal Nations Theme only represent additional resources that have not yet or cannot be considered a tribal climate resilience support tool, so make sure to review both Tools and Featured Content Section resources for best results.
