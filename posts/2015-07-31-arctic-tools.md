This page contains links to web-based tools and publicly accessible models to help understand, analyze, and assess the vulnerabilities and resilience of Arctic systems to climate variability, global climate change, and compounding stressors. Tools include interactive mapping applications as well as navigable libraries containing scientific and technical publications, additional datasets, or models. Please [let us know](http://www.data.gov/climate/climate-feedback/) if there are other tools that should be listed here.



* [AOOS Ocean Data Explorer](#aoos-ocean-data-explorer): The Alaska Ocean Observing System (AOOS) is a national network that works to address regional and national needs for ocean information, gather specific data on key coastal and ocean variables, and ensure timely and sustained dissemination and availability of these data. This portal contains scientific and management information including real-time sensor feeds, operational oceanographic and atmospheric models, satellite observations, and GIS datasets that describe the biological, chemical, and physical characteristics of Alaska and its surrounding waters.

* [Daily Values Water Services Test Tool](#daily-values-water-services-test-toolr): This tool provides a simple way to generate syntactically correct URLs to use with the USGS Daily Values web service. Use it to get comfortable with the service before creating your own applications.


* [Deptartment of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program – North Slope of Alaska Barrow Facility](#department-of-energy-doe-atmospheric-radiation-measurement-program-–-north-slope-of-alaska-barrow-facility): This comprehensive scientific infrastructure and data archive was designated by DOE as a scientific user facility—the ARM Climate Research Facility—in 2003, and is freely available for use by scientists worldwide.


* [Global Climate observing System (GCOS)](#global-climate-observing-system-gcos): GCOS is intended to be a long-term, user-driven operational system capable of providing the comprehensive observations required for various aspects of climate science. GCOS includes components focused on obtaining a comprehensive view of the spatial structure, trends, and variability of changes in active-layer thickness and permafrost temperature in the Arctic.


* [Groundwater Level Water Services Test Tool](#groundwater-level-water-services-test-tool): This tool provides a simple way to generate syntactically correct URLs to use with the USGS Groundwater Levels REST web service. Please note: this service provides historical, manually recorded groundwater levels only, which in many cases are decades old. Groundwater levels recorded by automated equipment are *not* provided by this service, but recent automated groundwater levels are available using the [instantaneous values web service](http://waterservices.usgs.gov/rest/IV-Service.html).


* [Ice-tethered Profilers (ITPs)](#ice-tethered-profilers-itps): ITP’s are inverted moorings with an anchor in a drifting ice floe supporting a cable that extends 800-1000 m below the floe. A vehicle with temperature and salinity sensors motors up and down the cable making Lagrangian measurements. ITPs have been deployed since 2004 with primarily support primarily from the National Science Foundation and more recently with support from the Office of Naval Research.


* [IImiq – Hydroclimate Database and Data Portal](#imiq-–-hydroclimate-database-and-data-portal): The Imiq – Hydroclimate Database and Data Portal provides access to the *Imiq* Hydroclimate Database, a central repository built by researchers at the University of Alaska Fairbanks that contains hydrologic and climate-related data from Alaska and nearby regions (The word *Imiq* means ‘freshwater’ in the Inupiat language of Northern Alaska.)


* [Instantaneous Values Water Services Test Tool](#instantaneous-values-water-services-test-tool): This tool provides a simple way to generate syntactically correct URLs to use with the USGS Instantaneous Values REST web service. Use it to get comfortable with the service before creating your own applications.

The Interactive Multi-sensor Snow and Ice Mapping System allows the user to create customized versions of these resources.


* [Marginal Ice Zone Departmental Research Initiative (MIZ DRI)](#marginal-ice-zone-departmental-research-initiative-miz-dri): This research initiative is a five-year (2012-2016) Office of Naval Research project with two objectives: (1) Understand atmosphere-ice-ocean-wave interactions and feedbacks in the summer marginal ice zone of the Beaufort Sea north of Alaska in order to improve coupled models and sea-ice prediction, and (2) demonstrate robotic technology for integrated observation of the coupled atmosphere-ice-ocean-wave system of the marginal ice zone.


* [National Land Cover Database](#national-land-cover-database): This National Land Cover Database Evaluation Visualization and Analysis (NLCD EVA) tool provides user-friendly access to national and state land-cover and land-cover-change information developed through the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium. NLCD EVA eliminates the need for desktop geographic information system software, or advanced technical expertise, by processing NLCD data for the user and providing easy access to that distilled information. The tool also summarizes general land-change trends and provides users with the option to specify and explore specific land-change classes of interest (e.g., forest-to-urban land change).


* [Next Generation Ecosystem Experiments (NGEE) Arctic](#next-generation-ecosystem-experiments-ngee): NGEE (Next Generation Ecosystem Experiments) Arctic is a Department of Energy program to improve process understanding and model representation of important ecosystem-climate feedbacks by quantifying the physical, chemical, and biological behavior of terrestrial ecosystems in Alaska.


* [NOAA Global Monitoring Division – Barrow Observatory](#noaa-global-monitoring-division-–-barrow-observatory): The Global Monitoring Division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’ Earth System Research Laboratory, conducts sustained observations and research related to carbon source and sink strengths, trends and global distributions of atmospheric constituents that are capable of forcing change in the climate of Earth through modification of the atmospheric radiative environment, that may cause depletion of the global ozone layer, and that affect baseline air quality.
